# simpy

A simple arithmetic expression parser based on [Vaughan Pratt parsing algorithm,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_parser) implemented in Python.

Simpy simply builds an abstract syntax tree of the arithmetic expressions using Pratt parsing technique (as opposed to regular recursive descent parsing), and then interprets such expressions from the built tree node.
